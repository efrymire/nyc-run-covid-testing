# nyc-run-covid-testing

A simple vanilla js website to visualize the city run covid centers, as reported through [the NYC H&H COVID-19 testing sites](https://www.nychealthandhospitals.org/covid-19-testing-sites/).
Many thanks to [ctbarna](https://github.com/ctbarna)'s open source project [covid-wait-times](https://github.com/ctbarna/covid-wait-times) releasing the wait times at each location.

To start up, run:
`npm run start` or `yarn start`
